# Day 11

We making this project today. Yess!

Ok, this was fun. Yes I googled a lot ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ but this is fun. This project itself is a simple console app which prints random letters from the english alphabet. It seemed pretty easy in my head but I struggled with it nonetheless. I found out about the **Convert** class in Ms docs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert.tochar?view=net-5.0) which converts an int to a char (in my case).
