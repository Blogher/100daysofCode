# Day 6

Worked with if and else statements, everything really works together. I also learnt how to generate random numbers using the .random property. I am working on doing the same thing with letters of the alphabet. 

So the major difference between VS code and VS is that VS is an Integrated Development environment - which simply means you can write your code from scratch and deploy to production all from it. VScode on the other hand is more light weight, and it is simply an editor (I am pushing my repos from it tho). VS is still a little daunting, so many processes running at the same. 

Sometimes I feel really bad when I don't get a concept easily, especially .NET concepts. I am focused and I will continue to learn and apply things. I really love this module, do check it out https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/csharp-if-elseif-else/
