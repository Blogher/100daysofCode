# Day 2

I learnt about strings, and touched variables briefly. I also learnt about hardcoding and string interpolation. Sometimes I forget I don't have to declare and assign on different lines. 

All I have to do is:
    string firstName = "Bidemi";
    decimal heightInFt = 5.5m;


And yes, I found out why decimals data types have the "m" suffix. Check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/numbers-in-csharp?tutorial-step=5)
