# Day 2

I learnt about strings, and touched variables briefly. I also learnt about hardcoding and string interpolation.

string name = "Bob";
int message = 3;
decimal temperature = 34.4m;

Console.WriteLine("Hello " + name + "! You have " + message + " in your inbox. The temperature is " + temperature + " celcius");

And yes, I found out why decimals data types have the "m" suffix
